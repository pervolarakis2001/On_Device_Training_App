# ðŸ“± Mobile Deep Learning Classifier

This Android application demonstrates how **deep neural networks** can be trained, deployed, and fine-tuned directly **on mobile devices** for **image classification**.

It was developed as part of a thesis exploring the feasibility, performance, and accuracy of on-device training compared to traditional off-device training.
